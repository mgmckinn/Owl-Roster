# Team Roster App

This is a simple web application for managing a team roster. It allows users to add and edit player names, change the team logo, and customize the color scheme to match the team colors.

## Features

- Add and edit player names in the batting order list
- Change the team logo
- Customize the color scheme of the batting order list
- Print the team roster

## Usage

1. To add a player, type the player's name in the "New name" field and click the "Add name" button.
2. To edit a player's name, click on the name in the list. This will turn the name into an editable field. Press enter or click outside the field to save the changes.

## Notes

- The player list is designed to always print on one page, but this may not work perfectly in all situations. If your content is too large to fit on one page, it may be cut off.
- The color scheme customization affects only the batting order list, not the entire page.
